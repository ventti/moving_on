# 'Moving on' by Vent

## Summary

C64 SID song "composed" in the partyplace [KozMOS 2022](https://csdb.dk/event/?id=3156) on Sat 12th of Feb 2022. 

This was just a quick experiment of whether to be able to create and publish a simple song 
within a few hours without any expectations or performance pressure in the competition. A compofiller, that is. ;-)

SID 8580 preferred for listening.
